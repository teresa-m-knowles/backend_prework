## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.   

A conditional statement are expressions which perform different operations if the statement is true or false.    

For example:  
```
            if cold==true
                puts "wear a jacket"
             end

             if 5 > 1
                puts "5 is bigger than 1"
             end

            ```



2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?   

To perform different operations depending on which condition is true.

3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?   

```
if condition
    code
end
```

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?  

You can use the elsif statement

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?


```
if conditions
  code
elsif condition b
  code
else code
end

```



6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?      

Perhaps to create loops. In the code of the if statement, we could add some condition that would alter the character of the variable, like +=5 or something similar. Then, we could create a loop with it until a certain value is reached.
